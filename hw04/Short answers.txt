Answers to Short Questions: Homework 4

1. The int* tmp variable is a point that has been dereferenced while trying to store the
value that the pointer 'a' is pointing to. If you want to store the value that 'a' is 
pointing at you have to declare it like: int tmp = *a;.

2. This code is not safe and leaves security holes. This code needs a int size
variable and increment it in the for loop. 
int size=0;
for(int=0; i<size-1 && string[i] != '\0'; ++i).

3. Something like this: function(a+2,3);.

4. The array is only created and used inside the function and will not be available
when it goes out of scope. If you want to use a function to return an array
you have to do something like:
	double* allocateArray(int length){
		return new int[length];
	}

5. The problem with this is that the string is not truncated with '\0' at the end. So 
it will need one more spot in the array in this case you will have to truncate the string
at the end manually:

	char string[6];
	string[0] = 'h';
	string[1] = 'e';
	string[2] = 'l';
	string[3] = 'l';
	string[4] = 'o';
	string[5] = '\0';
	
	printf("%s\n", string);
