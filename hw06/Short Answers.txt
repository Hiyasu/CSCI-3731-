Short Answers for Homework 6

1. Libraries are good for storing code that was written by others. Instead of writing a bunch of code
out yourself, you can just access a library for it. Chances are someone has already written code for
something you want to do. Instead of using hundreds of diffent .o files, you can link to a library which
is a collection of object files.

2. The two types of libraries are static and shared object libraries. The "Static" libraries works like
the object files they are made of. Linking to a static library makes it object files part of the executable
file just like the individual object files do. "Shared object" libraries, also known as "Dynamic Linked" 
Libraries, behave differently from static libraries. The main difference is that they stay separate from
the executable file. The code they contain is loaded upon runtime of the executable.
